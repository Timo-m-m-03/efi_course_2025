# Projections and Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

Jasper Slingsby


## Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

This is probably the hardest part of the whole ecological forecasting business... people!

<br/>

It is also a huge topic and not one I can cover in half a lecture. Here I just touch on a few hints and difficulties.


## Decision Support {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

First and foremost, ***the decision at hand may not be amenable to a quantitative approach***.

  - Ecological forecasting requires a ***clearly defined*** information need with a ***measurable*** (and modelable) state variable, framed within one or multiple ***decision alternatives*** (scenarios). 
  - There's also the risk of ***external factors making the forecasts unreliable***, especially if they are not controlled by the decision maker and/or their probability is unknown (e.g. fire, pandemics, etc). 



## Decision Support {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

These external factors are where developing ***scenarios with different boundary conditions can be very useful***. 

  - e.g. scenarios with and without a fire, or different future climate states under alternative development pathways, etc. 
  - Scenarios are often *"what if"* statements designed to address major sources of uncertainty that make it near-impossible to make accurate predictions with a single forecast.

> It's perhaps useful to note the distinction between ***predictions _versus_ projections***:

>  - _***predictions*** are statements about the probability of the occurrence of events or the state of variables in the future ***based on what we currently know***_
>  - _***projections*** are statements about the probability of the occurrence of events or the state of variables in the future ***given specific scenarios with clear boundary conditions***_

### In an ideal world...

You'll be working with an organized team that is a well-oiled machine at implementing ***Adaptive Management*** and ***Structured Decision Making*** and you can naturally slot into their workflow.

The advantages of Adaptive Management and Structured Decision Making are that they are founded on the concept of ***iterative learning cycles***, which they have in common with the ecological forecasting cycle and the scientific method.

```{r dietze2018F1b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Conceptual relationships between iterative ecological forecasting, adaptive decision-making, adaptive monitoring, and the scientific method cycles [@Dietze2018].", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dietze2018_F1.jpg")
```

<br>

You're already familiar with how the iterative ecological forecast cycle integrates with the Adaptive Management Cycle...

<br/>

The beauty for the forecaster in this scenario is that **a lot of the work is already done**. 

::: {.incremental}

- The decision alternatives (scenarios) have been well framed.
- The performance measures, state variables of interest and associated covariates mostly identified. 
- Iterations of the learning cycle may even have already begun (through the Adaptive Management Cycle) and all you need do is ***develop the existing qualitative model into something more quantitative*** as more data and understanding are accumulated.

```{r structureddecisions2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The Structured Decision Making Cycle *sensu* @Gregory2012.", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/structureddecisions.png")
```

::: {.column width="60%"}

Focused on the process of ***coming to a decision***, not the process of management, but very useful in the first iteration of the Adaptive Management Cycle. 

<br/>

::: {.fragment}

It is valuable when there are many stakeholders with ***disparate interests***. 

  - ***decisions are ultimately about values*** and often require evaluating trade-offs among properties with ***incomparable units*** - e.g. people housed/fed/watered vs species saved from extinction... 
  - this can be a highly emotive space, and greatly benefits from a structured facilitation process

```{r structureddecisions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The Structured Decision Making Cycle *sensu* @Gregory2012.", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/structureddecisions.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

It tries to bring ***all issues and values to light*** to be considered in a transparent framework where trade-offs can be identified and considered.

  - you can't make the right choice if it isn't on the table

It ***directly addresses the social, political or cognitive biases*** that marginalise some values or alternatives. 

::: {.fragment}

Many decisions pit people's immediate needs (water, housing, etc) against the environment. We'd rather ignore the fact that choosing one is choosing against the other, but ***if we're not transparent about this we're not going to learn from our decisions and improve them in the next iteration.***
